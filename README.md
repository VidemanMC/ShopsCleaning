# ShopsCleaning â€“ Cleaning system for rentable areas
Deletes shop mark from chests when the lease of the territory is expired, so that other players can use the chests to create own shops. By default, shops in [QuickShop-Hikari](https://github.com/QuickShop-Community/QuickShop-Hikari) are protected from modification.
